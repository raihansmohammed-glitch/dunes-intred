# The Dunes Intred
This game is inspired by Dungeons & Dragons (D&D). It is a simple text based game that allows the user to login and signup whenever they want, which inturn keeps all their data(ingame) and allows them to login and change the data by playing whenever they want.
## For just playing:
* If you just want to play the game, then inside 'All codes' folder, just download 1filecode(full).py.
* This is a huge code so I wouldn't recommend working on it.

## For editing and seeing the code:
* If you want to see or edit the code, I recommend you to download all the files in the GAMEFILES folder inside the app_divided folder
* This folder consists of the code divided into 4 parts so it is easier to understand and edit.
