# The Dunes Intred
    This game is inspired by Dungeons & Dragons (D&D)
## For just playing:
    * If you just want to play the game, then inside all codes folder, just download 1filecode(full).py.
    * This is a huge code so I wouldn't recommend working on it.
## For editing and seeing the code:
    * If you want to see or edit the code, i recommend you to download app_divided folder inside the all codes folder.
    * This folder consists of the code divided into 4 parts so it is easier to understand and edit.

Hope you enjoy my creation. I will update it almost everyday if I get time.
